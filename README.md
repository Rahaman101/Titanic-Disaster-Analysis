## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we aim to explore the dataset and answer some intriguing questions related to the passengers, their demographics, and their chances of survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their name, age, gender, ticket class, cabin, and whether they survived or not. You can find the dataset in the `data` directory.

## Installation

To run the analysis code, you'll need Python and some libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahaman101/Titanic-Disaster-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Titanic-Disaster-Analysis
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `Titanic_Disaster_Analysis.ipynb` notebook to explore the analysis.

## Analysis

In the Jupyter Notebook, you'll find a step-by-step analysis of the Titanic dataset. We cover various aspects, such as:

- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualization
- Survival Rates
- Passenger Demographics

Feel free to modify the code, add your own analysis, or use our findings for your projects.
